 * Decides from a workflow's event which commits {@code check-commits} reads, and whether they come

 * <p>A push reads from the commit it started from to the one that ran: a tag reads its own commit
 * alone; a start the checkout does not hold is refused on {@code main}, which only moves forward,
 * and elsewhere reads from {@code origin/main}. A pull request reads from its base to its head, and
 * comes from outside unless its head lives in this repository and it is opened by an owner or
 * member, by GitHub's Actions bot, or on a server other than github.com, where only write access
 * pushes a branch of the repository. Nothing a commit's message says earns an exemption here.
